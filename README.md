# ðŸ“ˆ Intraday Price Movements and Stability Trends

This project explores intraday price behavior and volatility stability for a specific stock/index, focusing on detecting trends, implementing backtesting strategies, and analyzing performance metrics using Python.

---

## ðŸš€ Objective

To analyze intraday price fluctuations and test simple trading strategies by backtesting, in order to uncover patterns and performance insights.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Source:** (Mention NSE, Yahoo Finance, or simulated data)
- **Backtesting Logic:** Custom Python functions

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- Time-series analysis of intraday price data  
- Moving average and price deviation calculations  
- Custom backtesting framework for simulating trades  
- Risk management rules: break-even points, time-based exits  
- Performance metrics: win rate, expected return, risk-reward ratio  
- Visualization of performance grouped by box sizes

---

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains exploratory and final analysis notebooks  
- `scripts/`: Custom functions for backtesting and metric calculation  
- `data/`: (Optional) Sample data used for testing  
- `images/`: Graphs used in the README or reporting
